* Online Shop Brief

** Model an online shop.
You are tasked with creating an e-commerce platform. Your online store may sell anything you wish.
It could be a niche, boutique store or a more general 'amazon' type. 
Customers will log in, add items to their basket and purchase them.

** Your shop should include;
*** A stock class with quantity, price and availability.
*** A basket class to represent the customer/user's items for purchase.
*** A user class with login details and purchase history.

** MVP
Your shop should be able to;
*** Add, update, display and remove products.
*** Allow users to add and remove items from their basket.
*** Baskets should keep a running total.
*** Sell products.
*** Apply discounts (e.g. 2 for 1, discount on bulk order).

Make sure you style your shop appropriately with CSS.

** Extensions.
*** Search for product by partial title.
*** Display products filtered by catagory.
